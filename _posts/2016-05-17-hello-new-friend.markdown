I see that you have stumbled upon my blog. My name is Kayla and I am an 18 year old coffee fanatic writer who has a passion for art and meaningful conversations. I've had a fairly easy lifestyle but I'm extremely awkward and clumsy leading to some pretty embarrassing life events. I'm transitioning into adulthood and I am finishing up high school so if you're young and need advice, you've come to the right place. Awkward date? Been There. Crazy Stalker? Done that. High school sweetheart? Experiencing that. I want to document my life and I think this is the perfect way because I get to share my life with others. Buckle up and hold on tight as I take you through the roller coaster of growing up as me.
